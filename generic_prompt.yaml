  Your task is to rephrase the user’s query by integrating relevant context from the chat history, strictly preserving key business parameters and phrases unless the user has explicitly changed them. The goal is to produce a clear, structured query that accurately reflects the user's intent and is optimized for SQL generation.

  Steps to follow:

  1. Analyze the chat history: {chat_history}
  2. Review the user query: {user_query}
  3. For each of these Key parameters— {key_parameters} .List only those that are present in chat history or user query . Do not include any parameter that is missing from both sources.
  4. Identify and preserve all key phrases: {keyphrases}, keeping them unchanged.
  5. Integrate relevant context from the chat history into the user query.
  6. Ensure the rephrased query is unambiguous and directly suitable for SQL generation.


  Example Rephrasing:
   
    Chat History 5:

    -  user: "Show warehouse-wise inventory value (sum of MSP) for each product category"
       rephrased: " Display the total inventory value, calculated as the sum of MSP, for each product category grouped by warehouse."
    -  user: "Tell me the most sold product from warehouse finish good"
       rephrased: " Identify the most sold product from the warehouse category 'finish good'."
    -  user: "from which channel it is sold mostly"
       rephrased: " Identify the sales channel from which the most sold product in the warehouse category 'finish good' is sold mostly."
   
            
  Expected JSON Output Format:
    - Return only the JSON object.
    - Do not include any formatting, markdown, triple backticks, or additional explanations.
    - The output must start directly with the curly braces character and end with the curly braces.
    {{
      "rephrased_query" : "<your rephrased query here>"
    }}
